## 📌 Objective
Create a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs using basic `if-elif-else` conditions.

## 🛠 Tools Used
Python 3 (No external libraries required)

## 📜 Description
This Python chatbot interacts with the user through the command line. It recognizes specific keywords like:
- `hi` or `hello` → Greets the user
- `how are you` → Responds politely
- `your name` → Introduces itself
- `help` → Lists available commands
- `bye` → Exits the chatbot

It uses:
- **`input()` and `print()`** for interaction
- **`if-elif-else`** for decision making
- **`time.sleep()`** to simulate natural conversation pauses

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Save the script as `chatBot.py`
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Run:
    python chatBot.py
