# chatBot
Hereâ€™s a **350-character description** for your chatbot:  > A simple Python rule-based chatbot that interacts via the command line using `if-elif-else` conditions. It responds to greetings, questions, and help requests, and exits on "bye". Includes short delays using `time.sleep()` for a natural feel. Ideal for learning loops and conditionals.
